# Kienning Bible

Digitization of the New Testament in the Kienning Colloquial (Séng iŏ̤ cṳ̌ing sṳ́: Gṳ̄ing-nǎing hǔ gâ̤ tǔ-kióng 《新約全書：建寧府個土腔》), written in Jian'ou dialect of Northern Min.

This endeavour has two goals:
* Digitization of the original Romanized text
* Converting the Romanized text into Chinese character

Digitization of the original Romanized text is achieved via the [transcription project](https://wikisource.org/wiki/Index:%E6%96%B0%E7%B4%84%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E5%BB%BA%E5%AF%A7%E5%BA%9C%E5%80%8B%E5%9C%9F%E8%85%94%E7%BE%85%E9%A6%AC%E5%AD%97.pdf) on Wikisource.
